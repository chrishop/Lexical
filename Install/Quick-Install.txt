QUICK INSTALL

I've created some scripts which automatically install the dependencies necessary to run the file
at the end of the installation it attempts to run the file if this doesnt work please refer to the manual installation
guide called "Manual-Install.txt"


WINDOWS

STEP 1
Install python 3.5.3 off the python website
on the first page of the installer make sure to TICK THE SET UP PATH BOX

STEP 2
run the install-windows.py file found unt the install folder (by double clicking it)
it will show a message box

NOW YOU HAVE INSTALLED
you have to go into the windows folder and run the "run.py" opening and then running with IDLE
(any other way will cause the program to crash)


LINUX

STEP 1
find the install-linux.sh file in your file manager

STEP 2
click on it and select the run in terminal option (may have to right click and choose from options)
a terminal window will appear

STEP 3
Enter your Password
when the it says "INSTALLATION COMPLETE"
you can close the box

NOW YOU HAVE INSTALLED
To run the project use the run-linux.sh (in the main folder, you may also have to run this from terminal)


MAC

STEP 1
run the install-mac.command file by double clicking

STEP 2
wait for abit (if it needs to install xcode it may take some time)
you also have to enter your password a couple of times
if the installation worked correctly it should say "INSTALLATION COMPLETE"

NOW YOU HAVE INSTALLED
To run the project use the run-mac.py (by running the program in idle or by left clicking and opening with python3 launcher)
